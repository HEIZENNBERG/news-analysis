  "text": "A productive conversation with President Trump, with the key focus of course being ending the war. We are grateful to @POTUS for all efforts toward a just and lasting peace. It is truly a must to stop the killing as soon as possible, and we fully support this. Many months could have already passed without war, had Russia not been prolonging it.\n\nToday, we coordinated our positions – Ukraine and the United States. We exchanged assessments of the situation: The Russians have intensified the brutality of their attacks. President Trump is fully informed about Russian strikes on Kyiv and other cities and communities.\n\nOf course, we spoke about sanctions against Russia. Their economy continues to decline, and that’s exactly why Moscow is so sensitive to this prospect and President Trump’s resolve. This can change a lot.\n\nWe discussed joint European decisions that can help our defense. We already have commitments from the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark – over one billion dollars for American weapons that Ukraine will receive. Thank you! This cooperation with NATO countries will continue.\n\nWe also discussed our bilateral defense cooperation with America. The draft agreement on drones has already been prepared by the Ukrainian side, we are ready to discuss it in detail and conclude it. One of the strongest agreements this could be.\n\nThank you to every American heart that supports our defense of life. Thank you, President Trump!",
