  "text": "ATTENTION!\n\nSubject: Flynn‚Äôs RULES for Diplomacy or How to avoid NUCLEAR WAR\n\nRule #1: The U.S. should not lie.\n\nRule #2: The U.S. must not break its word.\n\nRule #3: The U.S. should not insult, demean, ridicule, or threaten.\n\nRule #4: The U.S. should never support assassinations.\n\nRule #5: The U.S. should never call for regime change.\n\nRule #6: The U.S. should always be willing to negotiate.\n\nRule #7: The U.S. should view this dispute from the other nation‚Äôs perspective.\n\nRule #8: The U.S. should never back a nuclear power into a corner.\n\nRule #9: We should never assume that only the U.S. wants peace.\n\nRule #10: The U.S. should never steal.\n_________\n\nOur nation has seen endless wars for decades, but those wars have always been ‚Äúover there.‚Äù ¬†A NUCLEAR WAR would not be like that. ¬†\nAs President Kennedy explained, ‚Äú[War] makes no sense in an age when the deadly poisons produced by a NUCLEAR EXCHANGE would be carried by wind and water and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn.‚Äù\n\nIt is time for our leaders to control their emotions. ¬†It is time to guard our tongues. ¬†It is time to show respect to our adversaries as well as our friends. ¬†If we behave with respect, perhaps then we could find a way forward in order to achieve PEACE with our adversaries.\n\nOtherwise PRAY;\n\nAs in Timothy 2:2, ‚ÄúFor kings and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.‚Äù\n\nSee full article below.\n@SecRubio",
