  "text": "A big talking point of climate change skeptics is “…but the 1930s were hot!”\nIt’s true. They are right. 1930s summers were super hot in the US!\nBut zoom out, and most of the globe was not. \nTop image: 1930s global temp anomalies, compared to…\nBottom image: the last 10 years with warm orange colors everywhere.\nWhile the 1930s were indeed a relatively warm decade, they are no comparison to recent times, as the pace of human driven climate heating has far surpassed the pace of natural cycles - actually it’s about 10X faster than natural due to greenhouse heating from fossil fuel burning, land use changes, and variations in air pollution, plus climate feedbacks.  \nA note about the 1930s in the US. It was the Dust Bowl… a phenomenon caused by the intersection of a natural dry cycle in the US Plains and also horrible farming practices with the mass plowing of native Prairie grass. This resulted in incredibly hot summers in which many US heat records still stand today. Contrary to denial talking points, the 1930s in the US are further proof that us humans, even in the small numbers of the 1930s Plains, can have a profound impact on the climate.",
