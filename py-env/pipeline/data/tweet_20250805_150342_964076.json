  "text": "Been snapping daily on @cookiedotfun  lately - not just farming points, but actually getting deeper into the projects.\n\nSome of them? Genuinely interesting. Here’s a few that caught my attention this week: 👇\n→ @JoinSapien 🧠\nAI shouldn’t be trained on junk. Sapien gets it. Tasks are more about reasoning than labeling. You build rep by thinking, not clicking. It actually feels useful — both for the models and for you.\n\n→ @recallnet  📊\nOpen AI benchmarks, finally. Test models, contribute evaluation tasks, and earn based on accuracy. No closed doors, no \"research only\" barrier. Just provable predictions and real data.\n→ @OpenledgerHQ 🧾\nInfini-gram = receipts for content. Every post has a traceable source. Creators get credit, and it’s all enforced onchain. Plus they’re already rewarding contributors with some serious $$.\n\n→ @elympics_ai 🎮\nHumans vs AI, live matches, real stakes. You play to win — and earn. 5M+ games played already and more to come. Web3 gaming done right.\n→ @vooi_io 🎥\nEvery short-form video you post becomes an onchain badge. No fake engagement, no bots — just actual content that builds your identity (and earns you rewards). 1.25% supply going to early creators? Yes please.\n\n→ @tenprotocol 🔐\nEncrypted logic, private inputs, zero-knowledge agents — and it’s already live. TEN makes blockchain feel a little more… secure. Feels like real infrastructure, not just buzzwords.\n→ @build_on_bob 🟧\nNo wrapping, no bridges — just Bitcoin and smart contracts working together. BOB’s building something bold, and they’re rewarding creators big-time. I’ve seen some 🔥 memes from this campaign already.\n\n→ @Almanak__ 📈\nForget vibes - Almanak is simulating real DeFi strategies based on your goals. LPs, staking, risk balancing - the system thinks with you. Plus, clear explainers = rewards.\n Thinking of deploying some USDC soon to become a cSNAPS -feels like it’s worth going deeper here. 💸\n\n🧠 Quick thought:\nWeb3 is often full of noise, but this setup actually rewards contribution - not just hype.\nFeels good to be active in something that promotes long-term value and creativity.\n\nIf you’re snapping this week - which projects are you backing?\n\n👇 Drop your picks, let’s compare.",
